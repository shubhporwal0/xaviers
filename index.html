                <h2>10 Simple Cooking Tips</h2>

                <p>1. Set up your workspace by gathering clean tools, bowls and utensils. And make sure to keep a
                    trashcan within arm’s reach.<br>

                    2. To create an egg wash, whisk together a large egg with one tablespoon of water until smooth. Use
                    as a glue to seal pastries, then brush on top for a glossy appearance.<br>

                    3. Peel tomatoes with ease! Cut an X in the top, and then simmer in a pot of hot water for 15 to 30
                    seconds. Cool down and the skin will fall right off.<br>

                    4. Get comfortable! Wear comfy clothes and an apron when you work in the kitchen and you won’t have
                    to worry about getting dirty.<br>

                    5. Invest in a baking scale. Scales are not only an accurate way to measure your cooking
                    ingredients, but they streamline the entire process.<br>
                    6. Always read and re-read your recipes before you start cooking.<br>
                    7. Clean as you go.<br>
                    8. Use 2 skewers instead of 1 when grilling or roasting to prevent your food from spinning.<br>
                    9. Learn and practice the rule of thumb to check the readiness of steak.<br>
                    10. To prevent butter from over-browning in your pan, add a little bit of lemon juice.<br></p>
